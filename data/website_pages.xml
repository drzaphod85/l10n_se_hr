                                    <h3>Vacation (Semester)</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        According to Swedish law, all employees are entitled to 25 days of paid vacation per year.
                                        The vacation year runs from April 1 to March 31 of the following year.
                                        Employees earn vacation days during the "earning year" (April 1 to March 31) 
                                        and can use them in the following "vacation year" (April 1 to March 31).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Vacation pay is typically 12% of the total salary earned during the earning year, 
                                        or regular salary plus a vacation supplement.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Sick Leave (Sjukfrånvaro)</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The first day of a sick leave period is a "qualifying day" (karensdag) where no sick pay is provided.
                                        For days 2-14, the employer pays sick pay which is typically 80% of normal pay.
                                        From day 15, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (Försäkringskassan) takes over 
                                        and provides sickness benefits.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For sick leaves longer than 7 days, a doctor's certificate is required.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Parental Leave (Föräldraledighet)</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Parents in Sweden are entitled to a total of 480 days of paid parental leave per child.
                                        90 days are reserved for each parent (cannot be transferred to the other parent).
                                        Parental leave can be taken until the child is 12 years old (though most days should be used
                                        before the child is 4 years old).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Parental benefits are paid by Försäkringskassan, but some employers provide additional compensation.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Overtime (Övertid)</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The Swedish Working Hours Act limits overtime to 48 hours over a four-week period 
                                        or 50 hours over a calendar month, with a maximum of 200 hours per year.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Compensation for overtime is determined by collective agreements or employment contracts,
                                        typically in the form of money or time off in lieu.
                                    </p>
